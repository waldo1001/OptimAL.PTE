    <h2>OptimAL Business Operations Control Center</h2>

    <p>This interface provides access to core business operations:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Customer Management:</strong> Export, reporting, and dashboard functions</li>
        <li><strong>Analytics & Reporting:</strong> Sales analysis and revenue calculations</li>
        <li><strong>Order Processing:</strong> Batch operations and order management</li>
        <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> Test data generation and maintenance</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Execute operations to test system performance and identify optimization opportunities.</p>

    <h3>Ensuring Adequate Test Data</h3>

    <p>Most performance tests require a minimum of <strong>25,000 records</strong> in the Performance Test Customer
        table
        to produce meaningful results and demonstrate optimization improvements.</p>

    <p><strong>To check your current record count:</strong></p>
    <p>View the <strong>"Test Data Statistics"</strong> section on this page to see how many Customer records exist.
    </p>

    <p><strong>If you have fewer than 25,000 records:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>Locate the <strong>"Generate More Test Data"</strong> action</li>
        <li>Click the action to create additional records</li>
        <li>The system will generate records in batches until you reach the required minimum</li>
        <li>Wait for the generation process to complete (this may take a few minutes)</li>
        <li>Verify the record count has increased to at least 25,000</li>
    </ol>

    <p><em>Note: Data generation runs in the background via job queue entries. You can continue working while
            records are being created.</em></p>
